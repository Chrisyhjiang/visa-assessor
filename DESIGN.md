# O-1A Visa Assessment System Design Document

## Overview

This document explains the design choices made in implementing the O-1A Visa Qualification Assessment API. The system is designed to analyze a person's CV against the 8 criteria for O-1A visa qualification and provide an assessment of their eligibility.

## System Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture with the following components:

1. **API Layer (FastAPI)**: Handles HTTP requests and responses
2. **CV Parser**: Extracts text from PDF, DOCX, and TXT files and identifies domain-specific entities
3. **RAG System**: Provides relevant information about O-1A criteria
4. **Assessment Service**: Analyzes CVs against criteria and generates assessments
5. **Knowledge Base**: Contains information about each O-1A criterion

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Choice of Embedding Model: BGE Embeddings

**Decision**: Use BAAI's BGE embedding models with a fallback mechanism.

**Rationale**:

- **Adaptive Selection**: The system attempts to load the largest available model (bge-large-en-v1.5) first, then falls back to smaller models if necessary
- **Efficiency**: Even the small variant (384 dimensions) is computationally efficient
- **Performance**: All BGE models perform well on semantic search tasks
- **Balance**: Provides a good balance between accuracy and speed
- **Multilingual Support**: Excellent cross-lingual capabilities, supporting over 100 languages with consistent embedding quality
- **Cross-lingual Retrieval**: Able to match concepts across language boundaries, ideal for international applicants

**Implementation Details**:

- The system tries to load models in this order: bge-large-en-v1.5, bge-base-en-v1.5, bge-small-en-v1.5, bge-small-en
- Automatic fallback ensures the system works even with limited resources
- Leverages BGE's multilingual embeddings for knowledge base retrieval regardless of query language

### 2. Choice of LLM: Qwen2.5-0.5B

**Decision**: Use Qwen2.5-0.5B as the language model for CV analysis.

**Rationale**:

- **Size**: At only 0.5B parameters, it's one of the smallest capable LLMs available
- **Speed**: Provides fast inference, essential for a responsive API
- **Efficiency**: Low memory requirements (can run on CPU if needed)
- **Capability**: Despite its small size, it has sufficient reasoning capabilities for CV analysis
- **Open Source**: Freely available and can be deployed without API costs
- **Multilingual Excellence**: Exceptional multilingual capabilities, supporting dozens of languages without requiring translation services

**Implementation Details**:

- The model is loaded once at service initialization to avoid repeated loading costs
- Fallback to GPT-2 if Qwen2.5-0.5B cannot be loaded
- Leverages Qwen's multilingual tokenizer to process text in various languages

### 3. Direct Evidence Extraction

**Decision**: Implement direct evidence extraction for all criteria before falling back to LLM analysis.

**Rationale**:

- **Accuracy**: Direct extraction is more reliable than LLM-based extraction for specific patterns
- **Efficiency**: Reduces the need for LLM inference when clear evidence is present
- **Robustness**: Less prone to hallucinations or misinterpretations
- **Specialization**: Allows for criterion-specific extraction logic

**Implementation Details**:

- Specialized extraction methods for each criterion:
  - `_extract_awards_directly`: Identifies awards and honors
  - `_extract_memberships_directly`: Identifies professional memberships
  - `_extract_press_directly`: Identifies media coverage
  - `_extract_judging_directly`: Identifies judging activities
  - `_extract_original_contributions_directly`: Identifies innovations and contributions
  - `_extract_scholarly_articles_directly`: Identifies publications
  - `_extract_critical_employment`: Identifies STEM, government, and military positions
  - `_extract_salary_information`: Identifies salary data with specific thresholds

### 4. Cross-Industry Support

**Decision**: Expand domain entities and criteria keywords to support all fields of employment.

**Rationale**:

- **Inclusivity**: O-1A visas are available to individuals in any field
- **Accuracy**: Different industries use different terminology for similar achievements
- **Flexibility**: Allows the system to recognize achievements across diverse backgrounds

**Implementation Details**:

- Enhanced domain entities for various industries:
  - Business
  - Arts
  - Medicine
  - Law
  - Finance
  - Technology
  - Education
  - Government/Public Service
- Updated criterion descriptions to be applicable across different fields
- Expanded examples to cover diverse professions

### 5. Evidence Validation and Confidence Scoring

**Decision**: Implement robust evidence validation and confidence scoring mechanisms.

**Rationale**:

- **Accuracy**: Ensures only valid evidence contributes to the assessment
- **Reliability**: Prevents section titles, "N/A" values, and other non-evidence items from being counted
- **Nuance**: Different criteria may require different confidence thresholds

**Implementation Details**:

- Filtering mechanisms to remove invalid evidence:
  - `_is_section_title`: Detects and filters out section headers
  - Explicit checks for "N/A" and similar placeholders
  - Length and content validation for evidence items
- Specialized confidence scoring:
  - Salary-based confidence for High Remuneration
  - Position-based confidence for Critical Employment
  - Evidence count and quality-based confidence for other criteria

### 6. Self-Hosted LLM Instead of OpenAI API

**Decision**: Use a self-hosted Qwen2.5-0.5B model instead of relying on OpenAI API calls.

**Rationale**:

- **Cost Efficiency**: Eliminates ongoing API costs, making the system more economical for high-volume usage
- **Privacy and Data Security**: All CV data is processed locally without sending sensitive information to external APIs
- **Latency Reduction**: Eliminates network latency associated with API calls, resulting in faster response times
- **Reliability**: No dependency on external service availability or rate limits
- **Customization Control**: Complete control over model parameters, inference settings, and potential fine-tuning
- **Predictable Performance**: Consistent performance without being affected by OpenAI's model updates or changes
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Easier to comply with data residency requirements in regulated industries

**Implementation Details**:

- Local deployment of Qwen2.5-0.5B with optimized inference settings
- Fallback mechanism to GPT-2 if Qwen model loading fails
- Direct integration with the assessment pipeline without API middleware
- Custom prompt engineering optimized for the specific model architecture

## Assessment Methodology

The system follows a comprehensive assessment methodology:

1. **CV Parsing**: Extract text and identify domain-specific entities
2. **Direct Evidence Extraction**: Extract evidence for each criterion directly from the CV
3. **LLM-Based Analysis**: For criteria without direct evidence, use the LLM to analyze the CV
4. **Confidence Scoring**: Assign confidence scores based on the quality and quantity of evidence
5. **Overall Rating Determination**: Calculate the overall rating based on:
   - Number of criteria with valid evidence and confidence > 0.3
   - Average confidence of criteria with evidence
   - Specific thresholds for HIGH, MEDIUM, and LOW ratings
6. **Explanation Generation**: Generate a clear explanation of the assessment results

## Performance Considerations

1. **Model Loading**: Models are loaded once at service initialization to avoid repeated loading costs

2. **Caching**: The RAG service implements caching to avoid redundant processing

3. **Chunking Strategy**: CV text is split into manageable chunks to:

   - Avoid token limits
   - Focus analysis on relevant sections
   - Improve processing efficiency

4. **Vector Search Optimization**: FAISS is used for efficient similarity search

5. **Asynchronous Processing**: FastAPI's asynchronous capabilities are leveraged for handling concurrent requests

## Specialized Criteria Handling

### Critical Employment

The system identifies critical employment positions using:

1. **Job Entry Detection**: Extracts job entries from the CV
2. **Keyword Matching**: Matches against extensive lists of:
   - Technology Companies (Google, Microsoft, Apple, etc.)
   - Tech-related Terms (AI, Tech, Technologies, Labs, Research)
   - Executive Roles
   - Leadership Roles
   - Government Agencies and Roles
   - Military Branches and Roles
   - STEM Organizations and Roles
3. **Company Name Extraction**: Identifies company names from job entries
4. **Comprehensive Evidence Creation**: Combines job titles with company names (e.g., "Senior AI Researcher at TechVision AI")
5. **Education Filtering**: Filters out education items to avoid false positives
6. **Fallback Mechanisms**: If structured extraction fails, uses alternative methods to identify critical employment

### High Remuneration

The system identifies high remuneration using:

1. **Dedicated Section Detection**: Prioritizes information from dedicated compensation/salary sections
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Uses multiple regex patterns to identify salary information in various formats
3. **Total Compensation Handling**: Recognizes and properly values total compensation packages that include base salary, bonuses, and equity
4. **Threshold-Based Confidence**:
   - Low: Less than $150,000
   - Medium: $150,000 to $350,000
   - High: More than $350,000
5. **Context-Based Inference**: When exact amounts aren't available, infers compensation level from contextual clues
6. **Exclusion Filtering**: Avoids false positives by filtering out non-compensation financial mentions

### Multilingual Processing

The system handles CVs in multiple languages through:

1. **Native Language Processing**: Qwen2.5-0.5B processes text in its original language without translation
2. **Cross-lingual Understanding**: The model can understand concepts across languages (e.g., recognizing "Prix" in French as an award)
3. **Language Detection**: Automatically detects the CV language to apply appropriate processing
4. **Multilingual Keyword Recognition**: Domain-specific keywords are recognized across languages
5. **Consistent Scoring**: Maintains consistent evaluation standards regardless of CV language
6. **Cross-lingual Knowledge Retrieval**: BGE embeddings match relevant knowledge base entries even when the CV and knowledge base are in different languages

This capability is particularly valuable for O-1A visa applicants, who often come from diverse linguistic backgrounds.

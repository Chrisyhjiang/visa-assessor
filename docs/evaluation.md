# O-1A Visa Qualification Assessment System Evaluation

This document outlines the methodology for evaluating the O-1A Visa Qualification Assessment System.

## Evaluation Objectives

The evaluation aims to assess:

1. How accurately the system identifies matches for each O-1A criterion
2. How well the system's qualification ratings align with expert assessments
3. The quality and relevance of the explanations provided
4. The impact of RAG on system performance

## Evaluation Metrics

### 1. Accuracy Metrics

#### Criterion Match Precision

- **Definition**: The percentage of identified matches that are correct
- **Calculation**: `(True Positives) / (True Positives + False Positives)`
- **Target**: > 80%

#### Criterion Match Recall

- **Definition**: The percentage of actual matches that are identified
- **Calculation**: `(True Positives) / (True Positives + False Negatives)`
- **Target**: > 70%

#### Rating Accuracy

- **Definition**: The percentage of cases where the system's rating matches expert rating
- **Calculation**: `(Matching Ratings) / (Total Assessments)`
- **Target**: > 75%

### 2. Qualitative Metrics

#### Explanation Quality

- **Scale**: 1-5 (1 = Poor, 5 = Excellent)
- **Criteria**:
  - Relevance to the criterion
  - Clarity of reasoning
  - Specificity to the CV content
  - Factual correctness

#### User Satisfaction

- **Scale**: 1-5 (1 = Very Dissatisfied, 5 = Very Satisfied)
- **Criteria**:
  - Usefulness of assessment
  - Clarity of results
  - Perceived accuracy
  - Overall satisfaction

### 3. Performance Metrics

#### Processing Time

- **Definition**: Time taken to process a CV and generate an assessment
- **Target**: < 10 seconds

#### Error Rate

- **Definition**: Percentage of requests that result in errors
- **Target**: < 1%

## Evaluation Methodology

### 1. Test Dataset

Create a test dataset consisting of:

- 50+ real CVs with varying qualifications
- Expert assessments for each CV
- Diverse backgrounds and fields of expertise

### 2. Comparative Evaluation

Compare the performance of:

- Base model without RAG
- Base model with RAG

### 3. Expert Review

Have immigration experts review the system's assessments and rate them on:

- Accuracy of criterion matches
- Appropriateness of qualification rating
- Quality of explanations
- Overall assessment quality

### 4. Ablation Studies

Conduct ablation studies to measure the impact of:

- Different prompt designs
- RAG retrieval strategies
- Model size and capabilities

## Evaluation Process

### Step 1: Prepare Test Data

1. Collect a diverse set of CVs
2. Have experts assess each CV
3. Document the ground truth for each criterion

### Step 2: Run System Evaluations

1. Process each CV through all system configurations
2. Record all outputs and processing metrics
3. Compare outputs to ground truth

### Step 3: Expert Review

1. Have experts review system outputs
2. Rate outputs on qualitative metrics
3. Provide feedback on improvements

### Step 4: Analyze Results

1. Calculate all evaluation metrics
2. Identify strengths and weaknesses
3. Determine the most effective configuration

### Step 5: Iterate and Improve

1. Implement improvements based on findings
2. Re-evaluate with the same methodology
3. Document improvements and remaining challenges

## Continuous Evaluation

Implement a continuous evaluation process:

1. Collect user feedback on assessments
2. Periodically review a sample of assessments
3. Update the system based on feedback
4. Track performance metrics over time

## Evaluation Tools

### Confusion Matrix

Track true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives for each criterion to calculate precision and recall.

### Rating Comparison Matrix

Compare system ratings vs. expert ratings to identify patterns in rating discrepancies.

### Qualitative Feedback Form

Structured form for experts to provide feedback on system outputs.

## Expected Outcomes

The evaluation should provide:

1. Clear metrics on system performance
2. Insights into the impact of RAG
3. Identification of strengths and weaknesses
4. Guidance for future improvements

## Conclusion

This evaluation methodology provides a comprehensive approach to assessing the O-1A Visa Qualification Assessment System. By combining quantitative metrics with qualitative expert feedback, we can ensure the system meets the needs of users and provides accurate, helpful assessments.

This is a binary file and cannot be edited directly through text. Instead, you would need to:

1. Create a screenshot of the application when it's running
2. Save it as "screenshot.png" in the frontend/public directory

For now, I recommend using the frontend/public/favicon.svg as a temporary icon or taking a screenshot of the application once you've built and run it.
